# 0x03. C - Debugging
				
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.
	
## Technologies
		
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
		
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
		
		
## Files
		
All of the following files are programs written in C:
		
		
| Filename | Description |
		
| -------- | ----------- |
		
| `0-main.c, main.h` |  `test for a postitive_or_negative() function` |
		
| `1-main.c` | compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic |
		
| `2-largest_number.c, main.h` | prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case |
