# Pointers, arrays and strings
				
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.
	
## Technologies
		
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
		
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
		
		
## Files
		
All of the following files are programs written in C:
		
		
| Filename | Description |
		
| -------- | ----------- |
		
| `0-reset_to_98.c` | `takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98` |
		
| `1-swap.c` | function that swaps the values of two integers |
		
| `2-strlen.c` | function that returns the length of a string |
		
| `3-puts.c` | function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout |
		
| `4-print_rev.c` | prints a string, in reverse |
		
| `5-rev_string.c` | function that reverses a string |
		
| `6-puts2.c` | prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character |
		
| `7-puts_half.c` |  prints half of a string |
		
| `8-print_array.c` | function that prints n elements of an array of integers |
		
| `9-strcpy.c` | function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest |
