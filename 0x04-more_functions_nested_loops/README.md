# More functions, more nested loops
				
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.
	
## Technologies
		
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
		
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
		
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
		
		
## Files
		
All of the following files are programs written in C:
		
		
| Filename | Description |
		
| -------- | ----------- |
		
| `0. isupper` |  `checks for uppercase character` |
		
| `1-isdigit.c` | checks for a digit (0 through 9) |
		
| `2-mul.c` | Prints the multiplies two integers |
		
| `3-print_numbers.c` | prints the numbers, from 0 to 9 |
		
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` |  prints the numbers, from 0 to 9 |
		
| `5-more_numbers.c` |  prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14 |
		
| `6-print_line.c` |  draws a straight line  |
		
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | draws a diagonal line |
		
| `8-print_square.c` | Prints a square |
		
| `9-fizz_buzz.c` | Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line |
		
| `10-print_triangle.c` |  prints a triangle, followed by a new line |
